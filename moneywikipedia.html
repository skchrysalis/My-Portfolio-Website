        <p>No one knows for sure who first invented such money, but historians believe metal objects were first used as money as early as 5,000 B.C. Around 700 B.C., the Lydians became the first Western culture to make coins. Other countries and civilizations soon began to mint their own coins with specific values.</p> 

        <p>Today, most modern currency is not backed by silver or gold. Instead, today's money is known as fiat money. Fiat is a Latin word that means â€œlet it be done." Money has a certain value today because it was given that value by government fiat or decree. Legal tender laws now make it illegal to refuse legal currency in favor of some other form of payment.</p>

        <p>The first paper money issued in the United States occurred on March 10, 1862. The $5, $10, and $20 bills issued were made legal tender by an act of Congress on March 17, 1862.</p>

          <h2 id="part1">Why I think Money is amazing!</h2>
          <p> As Suzy Orman once said, "Money is such an amazing teacher: What you choose to do with your money shows whether you are truly powerful or powerless."</p>
          <p> The invention of money allowed globalization to thrive and made trade with one another and with other countries a lot easier. It was also much fairer in the sense that you would have an equivalent exchange for a product in terms of what you wanted.</p>
